# Space Invaders
This is a plain and simple Space Invaders emulator written in Java.

The emulator is incomplete. The Intel 8080 is only halfway finished, and it has not been hooked up to the Space Invaders system yet. There is a simple GUI that loads the ROMs (if you have them), and allows you to run the emulator step by step.

The ROMs seem to be available on the Internet. They need to be copied into the src/spaceinvaders/roms directory, before the project is build.
